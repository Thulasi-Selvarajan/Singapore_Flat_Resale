# Singapore_Flats_Resale

**Overview**

Welcome to the Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction project! This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict resale prices of flats in Singapore. By leveraging historical transaction data, the goal is to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

**Data Wrangling and EDA:**

*   Collect and preprocess resale flat transaction data.
*   Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and trends.

**Model Building:**

*   Choose and train a regression model using historical data.

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

   Collect and clean historical resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB).

**2. Feature Engineering:**

   Extract relevant features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
   Create additional features to improve prediction accuracy.

**3. Model Selection and Training:**

   Choose a suitable regression model and train it on the historical dataset.

**4. Model Evaluation:**

   Assess the model's predictive performance using regression metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score.

**5. Streamlit Web Application:**

   Develop an intuitive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input flat details for price predictions.

**6. Render Deployment:**
